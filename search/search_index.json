Equation of Motion A simple pendulum consists of a mass \\(m\\) attached to a string of length \\(L\\) , swinging under the influence of gravity. The equation governing its motion is: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = 0 \\] Where: - \\(\\theta\\) is the angular displacement (radians). \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity ($ 9.8 $ m/s\u00b2). \\(L\\) is the length of the pendulum. The term \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) accounts for the restoring torque due to gravity. This is a nonlinear second-order differential equation, making it difficult to solve analytically for large angles. 2. Small-Angle Approximation For small angles where $ \\theta \\approx \\sin(\\theta) $ (in radians), the equation simplifies to: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{g}{L} \\theta = 0 \\] This is a linear second-order ordinary differential equation, similar to a simple harmonic oscillator. 3. Solution for the Simple Pendulum For small oscillations, the solution takes the form: \\[ \\theta (t) = \\theta_0 \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) \\] Where: - \\(\\theta_0\\) is the initial amplitude. \\(\\phi\\) is the phase constant, determined by initial conditions. \\(\\omega\\) is the natural frequency of the pendulum, given by: \\[ \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\] 4. Energy of the Simple Pendulum The total mechanical energy $ E $ is the sum of kinetic and potential energy: \\[ E = T + U \\] Where: Kinetic Energy \\[ T = \\frac{1}{2} m L^2 \\left( \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\right)^2 \\] Potential Energy (measured from the lowest position) \\[ U = mgL(1 - \\cos\\theta) \\] The total energy remains constant for an ideal pendulum: \\[ E = \\frac{1}{2} m L^2 \\left( \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\right)^2 + mgL(1 - \\cos\\theta) \\] 5. Phase Space Representation A useful way to visualize pendulum motion is in phase space, plotting angular velocity $ \\dot{\\theta} $ against angular displacement $ \\theta $. The phase portrait shows closed curves for undamped motion, representing conservation of energy. 6.

Numerical Solution using Python"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/","text":"1. Differential Equation for Forced Damped Pendulum The general form of the equation of motion for a forced damped pendulum is: \\[ \\theta''(t) + \\gamma \\theta'(t) + \\omega_0^2 \\sin(\\theta(t)) = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Where: - \\(\\theta(t)\\) is the angular displacement of the pendulum as a function of time. - \\(\\gamma\\) is the damping coefficient (measuring the rate of energy dissipation). - \\(\\omega_0\\) is the natural frequency of the pendulum (without damping or external driving force). - \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the external driving force. - \\(\\omega\\) is the driving frequency of the external force. 2. Small-Angle Approximation For small oscillations where \\(\\theta(t)\\) is small (usually in radians), we can make the approximation: \\[ \\sin(\\theta(t)) \\approx \\theta(t) \\] This leads to the simplified linear equation: \\[ \\theta''(t) + \\gamma \\theta'(t) + \\omega_0^2 \\theta(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients, which is much easier to solve. 3. Solution for the Undamped, Unforced Case (Free Pendulum) For the case when there is no damping ( \\(\\gamma = 0\\) ) and no external driving force ( \\(A = 0\\) ), the equation simplifies to: \\[ \\theta''(t) + \\omega_0^2 \\theta(t) = 0 \\] This is a simple harmonic oscillator, and its solution is: \\[ \\theta(t) = \\theta_0 \\cos(\\omega_0 t + \\phi) \\] Where: - \\(\\theta_0\\) is the initial amplitude. - \\(\\phi\\) is the phase constant determined by initial conditions. 4. Solution for the Damped, Unforced Case (Damped Pendulum) When we add damping but no external forcing (i.e., \\(A = 0\\) ), the equation becomes: \\[ \\theta''(t) + \\gamma \\theta'(t) + \\omega_0^2 \\theta(t) = 0 \\] The solution to this equation depends on the value of the damping coefficient \\(\\gamma\\) . It can be categorized as: Underdamped ( \\(\\gamma^2 < 4 \\omega_0^2\\) )**: The pendulum oscillates with exponentially decaying amplitude. Critically damped ( \\(\\gamma^2 = 4 \\omega_0^2\\) ) : The pendulum returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating. Overdamped ( \\(\\gamma^2 > 4 \\omega_0^2\\) ) : The pendulum returns to equilibrium without oscillating, but slower than in the critically damped case. The solution for the underdamped case is: \\[ \\theta(t) = \\theta_0 e^{-\\gamma t / 2} \\cos(\\omega_d t + \\phi) \\] Where: - \\(\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)^2}\\) is the damped frequency. - \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\phi\\) are determined by initial conditions. - The exponential term \\(e^{-\\gamma t / 2}\\) represents the decaying amplitude. 5. Forced, Undamped Case (Driven Pendulum) When there is no damping ( \\(\\gamma = 0\\) ), but there is an external driving force, the equation becomes: \\[ \\theta''(t) + \\omega_0^2 \\theta(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] The solution to this equation is: \\[ \\theta(t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + (\\gamma \\omega)^2}} \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta) \\] Where: - \\(\\delta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma \\omega}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2}\\right)\\) is the phase shift. - \\(A\\) is the driving amplitude. - \\(\\omega\\) is the driving frequency. - \\(\\omega_0\\) is the natural frequency of the pendulum. 6. Forced and Damped Case (Complete System) For the complete system with both damping and external driving force, the general solution is given by the combination of the transient and steady-state solutions: \\[ \\theta(t) = \\theta_{\\text{transient}}(t) + \\theta_{\\text{steady}}(t) \\] The transient part of the solution represents the initial conditions and will decay over time due to damping. The steady-state part of the solution represents the long-term behavior of the system, which oscillates with a constant amplitude at the driving frequency. For steady-state oscillations, the solution is: \\[ \\theta(t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + (\\gamma \\omega)^2}} \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta) \\] This shows how the system responds to the periodic driving force in the long run. 7. Energy Considerations The total mechanical energy \\(E(t)\\) of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy: \\[ E(t) = \\frac{1}{2} m l^2 \\left( \\theta'(t)^2 + \\omega_0^2 \\theta(t)^2 \\right) \\] Where: - \\(m\\) is the mass of the pendulum. - \\(l\\) is the length of the pendulum. - \\(\\theta'(t)\\) is the angular velocity. - \\(\\theta(t)\\) is the angular displacement. For the forced damped pendulum, the energy fluctuates due to the energy supplied by the external driving force and the energy dissipated by damping. At resonance ( \\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\) ), the energy absorption is maximized. 8. Resonance and Frequency Response In resonance, the system oscillates with maximum amplitude. The resonance condition occurs when the driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) equals the natural frequency \\(\\omega_0\\) . In this case, the amplitude of the oscillations grows, which can be expressed as: \\[ \\theta_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{A}{\\gamma \\omega_0} \\] This shows that resonance can lead to large oscillations, especially if the damping is small. If the damping is large, the resonance effect is reduced.
